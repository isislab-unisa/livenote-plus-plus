# Introduction

Livenote++ is an Open Source tool that could help people to deliver lessons and webinar in a fast and scalable way.
The idea was born during the spread of Covid-19. We were looking for a FOSS that could be used by university's teachers to provide regular lessons to the students. Any platform that we've tried had subscrition fees for the Pro functionalities, or had problems about unstable connection, error and bug on high volume of clients and so on. So, like good programmers, we've started to build our own platform.

## What's Livenote++ for aim?

The aim of Livenote++ is to manage lesson/seminars from one person to a large number of spectators, but leaving them the possibility to interact with some tools. The main principle for this project is to have a lightweight platform to present a keynote or some slides. We've achieved this goal mixing some technologies -listed below- reducing the impact of communications or streaming between the clients.

## Features

For now, the project is full supported on Desktop browser (Chrome 37+, Opera 24+, Firefox54+)
All the features are available with a key combo, click on the nes console on the window to see them!

Stable:
* :zap: Stateless -no personal informations are stored-

* :sparkles: Live chat with your spectators
  * Insert your name and have real time feedback!
* :tada: Create real time poll
  * Multiple poll: With the open poll, write the question and various options. Students will choose the option they deem right.
  * Ranking poll: Do you want to know the reaction of the students to certain things, like whether they liked the lesson or not? Well! Now you can do it. Create a ranking by writing a question and selecting one of the various fancy emoticons :star: :heart:. Students will have the opportunity to express their satisfaction by filling in from 1 to 4 of the selected emoticons.
* :youtube: Embed your favourite youtube video!
  * You can insert the id of the youtube video you want to show during your presentation and have plenty control on it, synchronously with your watchers!

Unstable ():
* :pencil2: Draw on your slides with your mouse
  * You can also change the color and the width of the drawings!
  * There are minor bugs we are fixing, depending on the browser you are using!

Next steps:
* [ ] Travis
* [ ] Code coverage
* [ ] Full crossplatform 
* [ ] Upgrade of poll feature
